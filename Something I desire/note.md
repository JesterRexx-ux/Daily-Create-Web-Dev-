My name is Akshat Shukla and I am an college dropout. WHY doesn't matters here. I got a immense interest in machine learning and web development and I am doing
hell a lot I can to be one. Sometime this world wants you to belive that this isn't possible and try to make me quit and go back to where I came. But I don't want to.
I may be not the best developer yet but I am not gonna stop until I became one. I am having my lows due to my mistake only but soon I'll be out of this gonna be
doing what I love rest of my life. I make this file coz I wanna say to this community that I LOVE YOU and I AM READY FOR THE CHALLENGE.
From now its gonna be excessive amount of codes and contribution to my github and m gonna ACE it.
